# Integrated Segment, MongoDB Stitch, and MongoDB Atlas
This is an example repo designed to be used in conjunction with this [post](https://www.mongodb.com/blog).

We use MongoDB Stitch to connect Segment to Atlas, MongoDBâ€™s database as a service, via a custom webhook. This exercise does require the deployment of any servers.

## Folder Structure
FlayvaDemo - contains a simple html page that a user can add JavaScript into to track user generated events.
SegmentIntegration - contains an export of the MongoDB Stitch application we used as part of this demo. /Note: all api keys have been removed so you will need to create your own for this work./
